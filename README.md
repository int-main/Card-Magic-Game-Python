# Card Magic Game in Python
A Python program which simulates a card magic game.
<br><br>
In this game, the program asks the user to choose a card out of 52 cards and remember it.
<br>
Next, the cards are shuffled and divided into 4 groups(each group containing 13 cards). Now, the user needs to tell the program in which group the card is.
<br>
The above question is asked 2 more times.
<br>
Finally, the program will tell you the name of the card that you chose at the beginning.
<br><br>
This magic trick is nothing but a pure implementation of data structures and algorithms.
